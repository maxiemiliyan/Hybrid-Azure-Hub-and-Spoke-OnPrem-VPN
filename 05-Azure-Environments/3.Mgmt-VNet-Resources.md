# Azure Management Virtual Network (Mgmt VNet)

## Overview

The **Azure Management Virtual Network (Mgmt VNet)** hosts administrative and management workloads used to **monitor, manage, and troubleshoot** both Azure and on-premises resources.

This VNet represents a **secure management plane**, separated from application workloads to reduce risk and enforce the principle of least privilege.

All traffic from the Management VNet is **strictly routed through the Azure Hub VNet**, where centralized security inspection and routing controls are applied.

---

## Purpose of the Mgmt VNet

The Management VNet is designed to:

- Host administrative and management workloads
- Provide controlled access to application and on-prem resources
- Prevent direct exposure of management systems
- Enforce centralized security inspection
- Reduce the attack surface by isolating management traffic

This approach aligns with **enterprise security best practices**.

## Mgmt VNet Address Space

| Component | Address Range |
|---------|---------------|
| Mgmt VNet | `10.3.0.0/16` |
| Mgmt Subnet | `10.3.1.0/24` |

The address space is unique and does not overlap with other networks.

---

## Management Workload

- Deployed as a virtual machine in the Mgmt subnet
- Acts as an administrative jumpbox or management server
- Used to:
  - Access application workloads
  - Access on-premises resources
  - Perform monitoring and troubleshooting tasks

This workload does not host business applications.

---

## Network Isolation

The Mgmt VNet is isolated using the following mechanisms:

- No direct VNet peering with the App VNet
- User Defined Routes applied to the Mgmt subnet
- All outbound traffic routed through Azure Firewall in the Hub VNet

This prevents uncontrolled access to application workloads.

---

## Routing Configuration

### User Defined Routes (UDRs)

The Mgmt subnet has a route table associated with the following route:

Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
Next Hop: Virtual Appliance (Azure Firewall private IP)


This forces all outbound management traffic to be inspected centrally.

---

## Traffic Flow

### Mgmt VNet → App VNet

**Traffic Path:**
Mgmt VNet → Hub VNet → Azure Firewall → App VNet


Used for:
- Administrative access
- Monitoring
- Troubleshooting

---

### Mgmt VNet → On-Prem Resource

**Traffic Path:**
Mgmt VNet → Hub VNet → Azure Firewall → VPN Gateway → RRAS → On-Prem Resource


Used for:
- Managing on-prem services
- Hybrid troubleshooting

---

## Validation

The Mgmt VNet configuration is validated by:

- Confirming UDR association on the Mgmt subnet
- Testing access to App VNet workloads
- Testing access to on-prem resources
- Verifying Azure Firewall logs show management traffic inspection
- Confirming no direct access to App VNet exists without Hub transit

---

## Outcome

The Management VNet provides a **secure, isolated management layer** that enables controlled administration of both cloud and on-premises environments while maintaining strict security and routing enforcement.
